# Intro

Molecular phenotypes such as gene expression are a powerful tool for understanding physiology, disease, and evolutionary adaptations. In this context, average trait values are usually the focus of investigation, while variation is treated as a nuisance. However, gene expression variation can be directly involved in determining fitness [@Fraser2004-sv; @Wang2011-ts], and the relation between gene expression variation can be a powerful indicator of gene environment interactions and disease [@Lea2019-pq]. Understanding the landscape of gene expression variation, and how variable it is across genes and across human populations is then a neglected avenue to understand biological evolution and our relation to the environment.

The evolution of trait variation is still a poorly understood phenomena[@Hansen2011-es], and several competing forces act to shape gene expression variation [@Houle1998-mj; @Bruijning2020-bf].
Structure of gene expression variation can affect higher level phenotypes, and the interaction between stabilizing (variance reducing) selection and pleiotropy can lead to complicated dynamics [@Wagner1997-hw; @Wolf2001-fm]. 

The final observed gene expression variation is the product of several interacting processes, and genes are expected to differ in their gene expression variance due to several factors . genetic variation, selection, GxE interactions, robustness of gene expression regulation... Can we expect that the pattern of genetic variation across populations to be similar? Which genes are expected to change more or less? Which genes are expected to be more or less variable?

Evolution of canalization is still up in the air. Can some class of genes be less variable even in the face of genetic and environmental perturbations? 

Here we use public gene expression data sets to evaluate how the differences in gene expression variation is structured across independent samples. We collected and compared the gene expression variation across several studies, and used the similarities across these studies to create a gene expression variation ranking, which orders genes from least variable to most variable. We then explore the expected drivers of this gene expression ranking, showing that both cis and trans regulation are involved with the determination of gene expression variance.

# Discussion

Gene expression variance is reasonably conserved across studies.
Gene expression variance is predictive of biological function.
Gene expression variance can be partially explained by genetic variation and genetic associations between gene expression.

# Methods

## Data sources

We selected 60 studies with large sample sizes from public gene expression repositories recount3 [@Wilks2021-uj] and Expression Atlas [@Papatheodorou2020-dn]. We use studies to refer to independent data sets, which could have been generated by the same consortium. For example, the gTEX data are separated by tissue, and we refer to each tissue as a separate study. 

## Data processing pipeline

We use a standardized pipeline to measure gene expression variation while removing extraneous sources of variation. Case-control studies were filtered to keep only control samples. 

For each study, we filtered genes that did not achieve a minimum of 1 count per million (cpm) reads in all samples and a mean 5 cpm reads. To account for the mean variance relation in count data, remaining genes were subjected to the variance stabilizing transformation implemented in DESeq2 [@Love2014-mp]. Fixed effects were manually curated from the metadata for all studies and removed using a linear fixed effect model.Outlier individuals in the residual distribution were removed using a robust PCA approach of automatic outlier detection [@Chen2020-fy]. Gene expression standard deviation is measured in the residuals after fixed effect correction and outlier removal.

## Variance correlation

We assessed the similarity in gene expression variation across studies by using a between study Spearman correlation matrix of the measured standard deviations. Using Spearman correlations avoid problems related to overall scaling or coverage differences, and allows us to assess if the same genes are usually more or less variable across studies. To investigate the factors involved in determining correlations between studies, we used a varying effects model to investigate the effect of study origin and tissue on the correlations across studies. Given that most of the variation in the Spearman correlation across studies is expolained by a single principal component, we use the ranked projections of gene expression variance in this principal component to create an across study rank of gene variation. The higher the rank, the higher the gene standard deviation of a given gene. 

## Gene level statistics

__Genetic variation__: Pophuman measurements of gene level polimorphism (proxy for cis-regulation...)

__Gene connectivity__: As a proxy for the degree of trans regulation that each gene is subjected to, we calculate the average weighted connectivity for all genes. To do this, for each study, we create a fully connected gene-by-gene graph in which each edge is weighted by the Spearman correlation between gene expression. We then trim this graph by keeping only edges for which the Spearman correlation is significant at a false discovery rate of 1%. In this trimmed network, we then take the average of the Spearman correlation of all remaining edges for each gene. So, for each study we have a measure of the average correlation of each gene with every other gene. The average connectivity for each gene is the average across all studies in which that gene is expressed.As a proxy for the degree of trans regulation that each gene is subjected to, we calculate the average weighted connectivity for all genes.
